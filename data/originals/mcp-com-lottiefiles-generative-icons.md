# Generative Icons

**Animated icons. Ready to use. Built to extend.** By [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com).

An open family of native Lottie icons with Light and Strong motion, Outline, Solid and Duotone styles, and editable vector source. Install the icons you need into a web, iOS or Android app, or let your coding AI create a missing one in your own project with the `generative-icons` CLI.

## What's included

- **1,161 icons in 59 sets**, from essentials and arrows to AI, commerce, weather, smart home and emoji.
- **Light and Strong motion** for every icon, with explicit reverse or reset actions for stateful icons.
- **Outline, Solid and Duotone styles**, three outline weights (1.5, 2, 2.5), light and dark themes, and a recolorable primary slot.
- **Native dotLottie and Lottie JSON** on a 32 × 32 grid at 60 fps.
- **`generative-icons`**, one binary for macOS and Linux that finds, installs, creates, checks and previews icons, with an agent skill and an MCP server.
- **npm packages** for the web: per-icon data, a shared runtime and a React adapter.

Light and Strong describe motion intensity. Light, Regular and Bold describe outline weight. The two are independent.

## Use icons in your app

Run these in your app folder:

```sh
npx generative-icons init          # detect the app; write the config, agent skills and the authoring kit
npx generative-icons search heart  # find icons by meaning
npx generative-icons add heart     # install the .lottie asset and its descriptor
```

`init` detects web apps (`package.json`), iOS apps (an Xcode project or Swift package) and Android apps (a Gradle app module). On the web, render the icon with the runtime or the React component:

```jsx
'use client';
import { AnimatedIcon } from '@lottiefiles/generative-icons-react';
import icon, { src } from './generative-icons/heart.mjs';

export const Favorite = () => <AnimatedIcon icon={icon} src={src} size={24} />;
```

iOS and Android apps play the installed `.lottie` files with dotLottie for iOS and Android. See [installing the packages](docs/using-packages.md) for the web and the [CLI reference](docs/cli.md) for every command and platform.

`npx` runs the npm wrapper, which installs the prebuilt binary for your machine (macOS or Linux, arm64 or x64). Homebrew and a curl installer are planned.

### The agent skill

`init` installs the [`generative-icons` skill](skills/generative-icons/SKILL.md) into your app, at the CLI's version, so your coding agent can search, install, render and create icons for you. To install the skill on its own instead (for every project, or for an agent `init` doesn't set up), use the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh):

```sh
npx skills add LottieFiles/generative-icons --skill generative-icons
```

The skill only teaches your agent the workflow; the project still needs `npx generative-icons init`. After installing the skill this way, run `npx generative-icons init --agents none`, so `init` leaves your copy alone.

## Create a missing icon with your AI

`init` installs a `generative-icons` skill for Claude Code (`.claude/skills/`) and other agents (`.agents/skills/`), or install it with [the skills CLI](#the-agent-skill). Ask your agent for the icon you need; the skill walks it through this loop (prefix each command with `npx` unless the binary is on your `PATH`):

```sh
generative-icons context "mailbox: a letter drops in"   # family rules and the nearest references
generative-icons create mailbox --label "Mailbox"       # scaffold the icon's spec in your project
# the agent draws named parts and authors Light and Strong motion in generative-icons/icons/mailbox.icon.json
generative-icons check mailbox                          # offline checks, in milliseconds
generative-icons draft mailbox                          # a review sheet from the engine, nothing stored
generative-icons build mailbox                          # export, package, verify, preview and install
generative-icons preview mailbox                        # contact sheets the agent opens and reviews
```

**`draft` and `build` need a LottieFiles sign-in.** Native Lottie export runs on [Creator MCP](https://lottiefiles.com/mcp), LottieFiles' hosted engine (`https://creator.mcp.lottiefiles.com/mcp`), so run `generative-icons login` once in your terminal. `draft` and `build` send the icon's spec (its shapes and motion) to the engine; your app's code stays on your machine. Searching, installing, `check` and `preview` need no sign-in.

Icons you create stay in your project. To share one, `generative-icons submit <id>` publishes it in the [community](https://generativeicons.com/community/), where maintainers review it. See [creating icons](docs/creating-icons.md).
