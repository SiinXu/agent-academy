# Local SEO

A free, open-source Chrome and Firefox extension that audits Google Business Profiles and shows where a
business ranks in Google Maps. Your coding agent can drive it too.

Local SEO reads what Google Maps shows in your own browser: a business's categories (including
the secondary ones Maps hides), profile, reviews and posts, and where it ranks for a search from
any point on the map. It runs 39 checks and says what to fix first. A local MCP server and a
skills plugin let Claude Code, Codex and other agents run the same audits. Paid data, such as
large geo-grids and full review history, uses your own DataForSEO key, kept encrypted in the
extension. It needs no account and has no telemetry.

## Install

Install [Local SEO from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/local-seo-by-workpods/bljbmngieccnjdnlahdhgklcagfcphak).

For development or release testing, you can install an unpacked build:

1. Download `local-seo-<version>-chrome.zip` from Releases and unzip it into a folder you will
   keep.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`, turn on **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked** and choose the
   folder.
3. Pin Local SEO and click its icon to open the side panel.

To build it yourself (Node 22 or later): `npm install`, then `npm run release:zip`; the zip is in
`release/`. [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) has the details.

## Firefox

Firefox desktop 140 or later is supported. Build the package with
`npm run zip:firefox -w extension`. Firefox uses its sidebar and background event page, and stores
private settings and vault records in extension-origin IndexedDB. Its built-in data-consent
prompt covers the data optional provider features can transmit. Core audits require no paid keys.

The local bridge requires the exact Firefox installation origin shown in Settings. See
[Firefox bridge setup](docs/agents-and-skills.md#firefox).
